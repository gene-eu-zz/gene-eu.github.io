				<p>Avoid six mistakes.</p>

<ul>
<li>To endure patiently the suffering of subduing enemies, protecting friends, and working to make money and not to endure patiently the difficulties of dharma practice is mistaken patience.</li>
<li>To want wealth, happiness, and comfort in this life and to have no inclination to practice dharma thoroughly is mistaken inclination.</li>
<li>To enjoy the taste of wealth and possessions and not to enjoy the taste of hearing, reflection, and meditation on the dharma is mistaken enjoyment.</li>
<li>To have compassion for a person who puts up with hardship in order to practice dharma and not to have compassion for those who do evil is mistaken compassion.</li>
<li>To engage people who look to you in bettering only their position in this life and not to engage them in dharma is mistaken care.</li>
<li>To take joy in other people&rsquo;s unhappiness and in the sufferings of your enemies and not to take joy in virtue and happiness in nirvana or samsara is mistaken joy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid these six mistakes completely.</p>
