			<div class="markdown">
				<p>When illness, demons, interruptions, or disturbing emotions come unexpectedly, or if you see someone else troubled by some unpleasant situation, think, &ldquo;I shall just practice taking and sending.&rdquo; In all your virtuous thoughts and actions think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>May all sentient beings come to engage naturally in much greater dharma activity than this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do the same when you are happy and comfortable. If you have some evil thought or are forced to engage in some form of evil activity, think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>May every evil thought and action of every sentient being be gathered in this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, maintain the motivation to help others whatever you are doing: eating, sleeping, walking, or sitting. As soon as you encounter a situation, good or bad, work at this practice of mind training.</p>
