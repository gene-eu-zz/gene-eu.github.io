<p>The four applications are accumulating merit, con- fessing evil actions, giving torma to gods and demons, and offering torma to dakinis and protectors. These are the best of all methods for using adverse conditions as a path.</p>

<h2 id="accumulating-merit">ACCUMULATING MERIT</h2>

<p>For the first, you should consider:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish to be happy, but suffering and frustration are all that come. This fact reminds me to cease evil actions, which are the seeds of suffering, and to accumulate merit, the seed of comfort and happiness. I shall do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, gather merit to the best of your ability through physical, verbal, and mental activities such as offerings to your guru and the Three Jewels, service to the sangha, torma offerings to local spirits, offering candles, making clay reliquaries, prostrating yourself, circumambulating, taking refuge, arousing bodhicitta, and, particularly, using the seven-branch prayer and offering mandalas. Pray to put an end to hope and fear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s better for me to be ill,
I pray for the blessing of illness.
If it&rsquo;s better for me to recover,
I pray for the blessing of recovery.
If it&rsquo;s better for me to die,
I pray for the blessing of death.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="confessing-evil-actions">CONFESSING EVIL ACTIONS</h2>

<p>Second, with the same considerations as in the previous section, practice the four forces properly. The force of repudiation is to regret evil actions that you have done. The force of turning away from faults is the resolve not to repeat such actions, even at the risk of life. The force of reliance is taking refuge in the Three Jewels and arousing bodhicitta. The force of full engagement with remedies is the use of prayers that put an end to hope and fear, and the practice of the six kinds of remedies: meditation on emptiness, repetition of mantras and dharanis,  the making of images, performing the seven-branch prayer and offering mandalas, the recitation of sutras, and the repetition of special purification mantras.</p>

<h2 id="giving-torma-to-gods-and-demons">GIVING TORMA TO GODS AND DEMONS</h2>

<p>Third, give torma to troublemakers and direct them to enlightening activity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very kind of you to chase after me in response to what I&rsquo;ve done to you in the past and to bring this debt to my attention. I ask you to destroy me now. I ask you to make all the sufferings, unpleasantness, poverty, ruin, misery, and disease that sentient beings experience ripen in me. Make all sentient beings free from suffering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are unable to do that, give the torma and command them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I meditate on love, compassion, and taking and sending, I am doing as much as I can to help you both now and in the future. Don&rsquo;t obstruct me in the practice of dharma.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="offering-torma-to-dakinis-and-protectors">OFFERING TORMA TO DAKINIS AND PROTECTORS</h2>

<p>Fourth, offer torma to the protectors and direct them to be active in calming disruptive conditions and establishing conditions conducive to the practice of dharma. In particular, use the prayers given above to put an end to hope and fear.</p>
