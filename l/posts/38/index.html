				<p>Don&rsquo;t think: &ldquo;If that patron or person should become ill or die, I would receive a lot of food and money&rdquo; or &ldquo;If this fellow monk or these dharma companions were to die, I would obtain their images and books&rdquo; or &ldquo;If my colleagues were to die, all the merit would come to me alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if all my enemies were to die!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In a word, you must refrain from hoping for suffering to come to others as a way of extending your own comfort and happiness.</p>
