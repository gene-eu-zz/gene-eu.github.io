				<p>In general all appearances, and particularly adverse conditions, are like the distress experienced when you dream of being burnt in a fire or swept away by a flood. The confused appearances of mind are invested with a reality that they do not have. It is rigorously established that, although these appearances arise, there is not even a particle of true existence in them.</p>

<p>When you rest in a state in which appearances simply arise but there is no clinging to them:
- the dharmakaya aspect is that they are empty in nature,
- the nirmanakaya aspect is they appear with clarity
- the sambhogakaya aspect is that this emptiness and clarity occur together,
- and the svabhavikakaya aspect is that these are inseparable.</p>

<p>This key instruction, to rest evenly without grasping at origin, location, or cessation, points out the four kayas. It is the armor of view, the protection circle of emptiness, and the supreme instruction that cuts off confusion.</p>
