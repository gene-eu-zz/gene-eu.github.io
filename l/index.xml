      <description>Since the purpose of all dharma, both mahayana and hinayana, is simply to tame ego-clinging, as you practice dharma or work at mind training, ego-clinging should decrease.</description>

      <description>Analysis itself is used to correct mistakes in analysis. If, when you are meditating on mind training, adverse conditions develop, people criticize and insult you, demons, devils, enemies, and disputes trouble you, your disturbing emotions become stronger, or you have no desire to meditate, think:</description>

      <description>When there is never any fear or despair no matter what adversity or suffering is encountered, when difficulty is taken as an aid to mind training and you always have the help of a joyful mind, then you have acquired proficiency in mind training.</description>

      <description>Meditate by skillfully bringing out extra love and compassion for subjects that present difficulties in mind training: aggressive enemies, troublesome obstacles, particularly those who act perversely and respond to your help by making trouble, people who compete with you, casual friends, people who are troublesome even though there is no bad feeling, or those with whom you just don&amp;rsquo;t get along.</description>

      <description>Of the three general principles, the first is not to break the promises you have made in mind training, that is, not to be tarnished by any fault or failing in any vow you have taken, including even the most minor precepts of individual liberation, bodhisattva, or vajrayana ordinations.</description>

      <description>At the beginning, as soon as you wake up 1n the morning, generate very strongly the impetus:
 Today, I shall keep the two bodhicittas with me.</description>

      <description>In order to be able to take on the sufferings of others, begin the sequence of exchange with yourself. Right now, take on mentally all the suffering that will ripen for you in the future.</description>

      <guid>http://ivychapel.ink/l/posts/46/</guid>
      <description>Learn not to let these three things weaken:
 Faith and respect for your guru must not weaken since all the fine qualities of mahayana dharma depend on him.</description>

      <description>In a horse race, the aim is to be the fastest. Among dharma people there are often hopes of receiving more attention or being more highly regarded than others, and little schemes are made up to find ways to acquire possessions.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t take a jealous attitude toward others. When others disparage you in public or cause trouble for you, don&amp;rsquo;t react or let your mind and feelings be disturbed.</description>

      <description>In general, don&amp;rsquo;t take joy in disparaging others. In particular, when another person says something bad about you, don&amp;rsquo;t respond by talking maliciously about him to others.</description>

      <description>A person who sometimes practices and sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t has not developed a definite understanding of dharma. Don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of projects on your mind, but do mind training single-mindedly.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t make a fuss.</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t make a big fuss even when you are kind to another person, because you are, in fact, just working at regarding others as more important than yourself.</description>

      <description>Avoid six mistakes.
 To endure patiently the suffering of subduing enemies, protecting friends, and working to make money and not to endure patiently the difficulties of dharma practice is mistaken patience.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t make things painful.</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t speak in a way that causes pain for others, either by making pointed remarks and exposing their faults or, in the case of nonhuman beings, by using mantras that drain their life.</description>

      <description>To give someone else an unpleasant job that is your responsibility or, by resorting to trickery, to shift a problem you have encountered to someone else is like putting a horse&amp;rsquo;s load on a pony.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t reduce a god to demon.</title>

      <guid>http://ivychapel.ink/l/posts/37/</guid>
      <description>If, as you meditate on mind training, your personality becomes stiff with pride and arrogance, it&amp;rsquo;s as though you have reduced a god to a demon; dharma has become nondharma.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t rely on consistency.</title>

      <description>If you accept a setback for the time being out of a desire for future benefits for yourself or if you practice mind training expecting to cure illness and mental disturbances and ward off adverse situations, your practice is mistaken, like someone contriving magical rituals.</description>
    </item>

      <title>Don&#39;t seek pain as source of happiness.</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t think: &amp;ldquo;If that patron or person should become ill or die, I would receive a lot of food and money&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If this fellow monk or these dharma companions were to die, I would obtain their images and books&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If my colleagues were to die, all the merit would come to me alone&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be wonderful if all my enemies were to die!</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t discuss unpleasant subjects: other people&amp;rsquo;s faults in wordly matters (such as physical or mental disabilities) or their faults in spiritual matters (violations of ordination, for instance).</description>

      <description>Do not think about other people&amp;rsquo;s affairs: in general, the faults of any sentient being, but in particular, the faults of anyone who has entered the practice of dharma.</description>

      <description>Relative Bodhicitta For the first way:
 Drive all blame into one
 Whether you are physically ill, troubled in your mind, insulted by others, or bothered by enemies and disputes, in short, whatever annoyance, major or minor, comes up in your life or affairs, do not lay the blame on anything else, thinking that such-and-such caused this or that problem.</description>

      <guid>http://ivychapel.ink/l/posts/4/</guid>
      <description>When you look at the presence of the remedy itself, these thoughts about the absence of true existence, there is nothing for mind to refer to and they subside naturally on their own.</description>

      <description>When you look directly at the presence of mind, no color, no shape, no form is perceived. Since mind has no origin, it has never come into existence in the first place.</description>

      <description>You must find freedom from disturbing emotions and ego-clinging by constantly examining and investigating your course of experience. Therefore, turn your attention to an object that gives rise to disturbing emotions.</description>

      <description>As you think:
 All these parents of mine, who are the focus of compassion, are hurt directly by suffering and indirectly by the source of suffering, so I shall take on myself all the different kinds of suffering in all my mothers&amp;rsquo; course of experience and the source of suffering, all disturbing emotions and actions.</description>

      <description>A skilled horseman does not fall from his horse, even when he is distracted. In the same way, if you are able to take adverse conditions that suddenly develop as aids to mind training even without expressly directing your attention to do so, then you are proficient in mind training.</description>
