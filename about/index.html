<h3 id="previously">Previously.</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around software, networks and information security since I was a kid. Unsurprisingly, most of my professional career revolved around technology: I&rsquo;ve worked as software engineer, systems administrator, security engineer, tech lead, CTO and COO in various companies. For the last decade I&rsquo;ve worked for companies I&rsquo;ve co-founded, because skin in the game keeps you evolving better than any self-help guru or productivity hack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky to work in various industries - in telco, finance, govtech, data security and pure software development. I&rsquo;ve briefly ventured into healthcare, broadcast/cine engineering, advertising, agricultural automation and SCADA systems as well.</p>
<h3 id="now">Now.</h3>
<p>CTO/co-founder at <a href="https://www.cossacklabs.com">Cossack Labs</a>, where we help the next generation of tech businesses to protect sensitive data conveniently. We do that by building tools, bespoke solutions and providing custom R&amp;D for companies who need novel solutions to specific problems.</p>
<p>In rare moments spare of rush and care, I mostly stand (or sit) and stare.</p>
