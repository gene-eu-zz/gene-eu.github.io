<p>Lately, with increasing frequency, I became subject to real-world effects of bad software (yes, that one which is eating the world, supposedly).</p>

<p><img src="/media/1*UIUTg7WuEZTQlweW8X0XaQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A flight could not depart for 70 minutes, because remote airport wouldn‚Äôt register arriving passenger‚Äôs documents, due to ‚Äòsome security certificate problem‚Äô (someone forgot to update pinned certificate? remote certificate expired?).</p>

<p>A taxi service, which sold me over 1000 taxi rides over recent years, sent a car to the wrong address 5 times in a row: something with navigation software for their drivers. Result? Lots of burnt gas and extremely pissed off customer who stopped using their services.</p>

<p>Fiscal authority, whose tax margin processing code ended up keeping over 10000 tax inspectors across Ukraine busy for a week, manually verifying sudden splash of penalties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Let me take my doomsday hat on:</em><strong>we will quicker eliminate humanity with poor code and accumulating technical debt, rather than SkyNet gaining freedom of will and using it wrongly</strong><em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was markup error on a webpage, even causing your browser to crash, damage is still contained within the ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù world: some ads wouldn‚Äôt be shown, some goods or services might be not purchased, but nothing harmful would physically happen.</p>

<p>Compare ‚Äòads are not showing‚Äô to ‚Äò10km taxi pickup ride, sent at the wrong address‚Äô, multiply by number of pickups an hour: direct financial loss, CO2 emissions, burnt nerves, missed appointments, and someone getting road rage-y.</p>

<p>Or to potential implications of delaying a flight.</p>

<div align="center"><small>Banning the sources of bad code: non-IATA edition</small></div></p>

<p>Most of the bugs are not self-isolated events: they are result of poor decisions, untested errors in blindly chosen dependencies, wrong priorities and planning. They are a part of the technical debt ‚Äî things we should‚Äôve done but didn‚Äôt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As we, engineers, know, technical debt is a dangerous beast ‚Äî and it slowly creeps into physical world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right now, it takes <a href="https://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf">serious malware expertise to attack SCADA systems</a> . Fast-forward a dozen years forth: rising demand for cheap coding for physical devices, negligence of proper engineering practices will lead us to former JavaScript programmers (now ‚Äòsenior engineers with 10+ years of ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù experience‚Äô) writing logical code for power plants.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not afraid of SkyNet anymore. It feels like the world will burn way before that, when fancy UI will eat out Chrome‚Äôs memory and somewhere, poorly designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule">two man rule</a> will fall back to a wrong default ‚Äî ‚ÄúJust make the rockets fly‚Äù,- than any neural net will learn about futility of human race as evolutionary exercise.</p>

<p>Or, we might learn to cope with poor practices, manage technical debt and strive for writing better software. It‚Äôs not as hard as riding a unicorn over the rainbow, isn‚Äôt it?</p>

<p>Have a sarcastic unicorn for no apparent reason: ü¶Ñ.</p>
