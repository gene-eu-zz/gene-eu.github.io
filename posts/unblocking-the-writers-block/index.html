			<p>For a while I&rsquo;ve been thinking of this blog as an exile for long trains of thought. Laid out in few long sessions. Driven by something that I find interesting enough and amusing enough. This blog is unlikely to carry on like that, and this is my excuse note.</p>
<p>There have been different stages in my life and career. Some of them felt slow, some of them felt fast, some left room for play, some made me lay. The one I&rsquo;m going through right now leaves me with very little leisure time, and I typically spend it in leisure activities.</p>
<p>But the ideas keep on popping up!</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an SLA change to accommodate the new realities and keep the ball rolling. Author is going to exert reasonable effort to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish short posts that don&rsquo;t take me long to write.</li>
<li>Link together posts that belong to one trail of thought.</li>
<li>Posts might be more frequent, though!</li>
<li>Longer form is coming back, but I&rsquo;m not sure about when.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s roll ahead.</p>
