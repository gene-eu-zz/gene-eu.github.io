				<p>As you think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All these parents of mine, who are the focus of compassion, are hurt directly by suffering and indirectly by the source of suffering, so I shall take on myself all the different kinds of suffering in all my mothers&rsquo; course of experience and the source of suffering, all disturbing emotions and actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meditate that all of this negativity comes to you and foster a strong feeling of joy at the same time.</p>

<p>As you think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without regret, I send all my virtuous activity and happiness in the past, present, and future, my wealth, and my body to all sentient beings, my parents,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meditate that each individual receives all this happiness and cultivate a strong feeling of joy in each one&rsquo;s receiving it.</p>

<p>In order to make this imagined exchange clearer, as you breathe in, imagine that black tar collecting all the suffering, obscurations, and evil of all sentient beings enters your own nostrils and is absorbed into your heart. Think that all sentient beings are forever free of misery and evil. As you breathe out, imagine that all your happiness and virtue pour out in the form of rays of moonlight from your nostrils and are absorbed by every sentient being. With great joy, think that all of them immediately attain buddhahood. To train the mind, use this practice of taking and sending with the breath as the actual practice for the period of meditation. Subsequently, always maintain the practice through mindfulness and continue to work with it. Shantideva, who has described this practice extensively, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t completely exchange
My happiness for others&rsquo; sorrow,
Buddhahood will not be realized.
There is no happiness in samsara.</p>
</blockquote>
