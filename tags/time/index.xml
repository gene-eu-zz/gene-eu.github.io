      <description>Over the last decade I went through a set of slow “getting-used-to-this-thought” realisations. They have transformed the way I work and what I work on. Being obvious, they matter to me more than many eureka moments and epiphanies.
When I was younger, time was abundant, and I learnt to play as if time didn’t exist. When you don’t mind time, it doesn’t exist in your experience.
As time, subjectively inexistent, but objectively observable, passes, it suddenly starts to matter.</description>
