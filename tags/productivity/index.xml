      <description>Over the last decade I went through a set of slow “getting-used-to-this-thought” realisations about time. They have transformed the way I work and what I work on. Many humans have walked this track of thought, many of their words echo in mine, so I&amp;rsquo;ll add mine to this infinite pool. Being obvious, they matter to me more than many eureka moments and epiphanies.
When I was younger, time was abundant, and I learnt to play as if time didn’t exist.</description>
