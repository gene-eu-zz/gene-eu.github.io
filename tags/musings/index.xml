      <description>Once in a while I read about another decentralized social network, full of great social ideas, strong privacy features, interesting cryptographic defenses against data misuse. The new underdog is typically on a mission to finally disrupt &amp;ldquo;centralized&amp;rdquo; social media platform as we know it, but in a nice fair way. Then it goes away into oblivion again.
Discussion around how these decentralized platforms fail almost always misses the reason “why”, focusing on the technical “how” instead.</description>
