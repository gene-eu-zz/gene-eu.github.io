      <title>On time / 1</title>

      <description>Over the last decade I went through a set of slow “getting-used-to-this-thought” realisations. They have transformed the way I work and what I work on. Being obvious, they matter to me more than many eureka moments and epiphanies.
When I was younger, time was abundant, and I learnt to play as if time didn’t exist. When you don’t mind time, it doesn’t exist in your experience.
As time, subjectively inexistent, but objectively observable, passes, it suddenly starts to matter.</description>

      <title>Less obvious parts of security asymmetries</title>

      <description>If you’ve been around infosec industry for a while, you might be familiar with an old adage:
 defender has to get most (if not all) things right to meet his goals, while attacker has to get a few things right and he wins.
 This is unfair, but the closer you look, the more asymmetries unfold: for example, what exactly does “get things right” mean? It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting mental exercise, so let’s do it together.</description>

      <title>Unblocking the writer&#39;s block</title>

      <description>For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of this blog as an exile for long trains of thought. Laid out in few long sessions. Driven by something that I find interesting enough and amusing enough. This blog is unlikely to carry on like that, and this is my excuse note.
There have been different stages in my life and career. Some of them felt slow, some of them felt fast, some left room for play, some made me lay.</description>

      <title>On avoiding band-aid security</title>

      <description>Applying band-aid to open wounds is an important step in preventing further infection, yet it rarely addresses the underlying issue.
Some of my work duties as an executive in a security products companyis helping key customers better understand the security challenges they’re going through, and shape the vision for future improvements.
The other day I was talking to a customer, and a familiar narrative surfaced:
 “We’ve had a pentest from company X, we’ve covered 100% of detected weaknesses, devised long-term security improvement program based on their recommendations, yet, a year after that, we’ve had 2 incidents.</description>

      <title>Kubler-Ross model for engineers turning into managers</title>

      <description>Having quickly jumped position ladders in the past, I always had that scary stare in the mirror: “I am not supposed to build new great stuff with my hands anymore”. In my own life, I was lucky to be facing the need to build companies — which is even more challenging. But for many, life turns into endless position hopping in the Dilbert comic.
Many of my peers struggle to the very day, so here you go:</description>

      <title>Two types of engineering for resiliency</title>
      <link>https://ivychapel.ink/posts/two-types-of-engineering-for-resiliency/</link>

      <description>I spend quite a lot of time thinking about the way we think.
In particular, I think a lot about the way we make engineering choices that mitigate risks. So, this is another brief note on the subject, following the beautiful metaphor I overheard:
 There are two metaphors for resiliency and risk management in traditional engineering — the NASA way and the US Navy way.
  NASA way is about provably correct systems, consistent engineering, repeatable practices and forbidding certain system behaviors that impose great risk, or working around it with systematic redundancy.</description>

      <title>Why decentralized social services fail (so far)</title>
      <link>https://ivychapel.ink/posts/why-decentralized-social-services-fail-so-far/</link>

      <description>Once in a while I read about another decentralized social network, full of great social ideas, strong privacy features, interesting cryptographic defenses against data misuse. The new underdog is typically on a mission to finally disrupt &amp;ldquo;centralized&amp;rdquo; social media platform as we know it, but in a nice fair way. Then it goes away into oblivion again.
Discussion around how these decentralized platforms fail almost always misses the reason “why”, focusing on the technical “how” instead.</description>

      <title>On keeping secrets in comfort</title>

      <description>As someone who used to spend a lot of time analyzing how security incidents happen, I frequently think how little, unfortunately, technical peculiarities have to do with most security breaches.
 Making people keep secrets is very hard. Making groups follow guidelines is laborious. Making secrecy policies work in groups is even harder.
You can fail only once .
 To prevent OPSEC failures, we’re constructing hi-tech clutches to human problems, frequently without trying to understand the nature of the problem.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Eugene Pilyankevich.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the way humans think and behave under uncertainty and pressure, because I think that&amp;rsquo;s what life is made of mostly.
Previously. I&amp;rsquo;ve been around software, networks and information security since I was a kid. Unsurprisingly, most of my professional career revolved around technology: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as software engineer, systems administrator, security engineer, tech lead, CTO and COO in various companies. For the last decade I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for companies I&amp;rsquo;ve co-founded, because skin in the game keeps you evolving better than any self-help guru or productivity hack.</description>
